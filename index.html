        Steve Jobs was born on February 24, 1955, in San Francisco, California, to Joanne Schieble and Abdulfattah Jandali, two University of Wisconsin graduate students who put him up for adoption. He was adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs, and grew up in Mountain View, California. As a child, Jobs was intelligent and curious, with a love for electronics and gadgets. He often experimented with electronics, taking them apart and putting them back together to see how they worked. He attended Homestead High School in Cupertino, where he met Steve Wozniak, who would later become his business partner. Jobs was not a particularly good student, but he was interested in spirituality and dropped out of college to explore his interests in Eastern mysticism and personal growth.
